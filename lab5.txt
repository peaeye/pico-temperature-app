1. One design decision that made this assignment easier was having all my rulesets depend on global variables. 
This way, if I needed to replace the variable with a function call from a module, 
all I had to do was look for the variable name and replace it, instead of looking for stray numbers in the code.
One design decision that made this assigment harder was my usage of both camel case and underscores.
It made me have to check each time to see if the variable I was using used camel case or underscores.

2. Entity variables can only be directly modified by the ruleset that contains it. All other rulesets that want to change it have to do so through the rule.
Because of this distinction of changing data and getting data, it's easy to debug where errors come from. 

3. The use the functions that sensor_profile provides in order to get the specific profile values.

4. They can store values in the sensor profile's variables by using the rule update_profile. Other than that, they can't interact with the entity variables at all.
